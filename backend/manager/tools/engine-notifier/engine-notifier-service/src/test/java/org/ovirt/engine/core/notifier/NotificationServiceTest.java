     * <li>Verify the same amount of events which suppose to be notified were added to the history table
     * <li>Verify the same amount of events were marked as processed
     * <li>Verify there are no events documented in the history table with failure status
     * <li>Using a read mail client, connect to the mailbox and count the received mails
